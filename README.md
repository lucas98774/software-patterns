# Software Overview

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to document software patterns that I have learned so far, found useful/applicable to data science and give links or examples that I have done.

## List of Patterns

I will try to organize these patterns in order of usefulness but this is subject to change. Also there will be a usefulness rating provided as well on the scale from 1 to 5, 1 being very useful, 5 being rarely useful.


Pattern | Type | Usefulness Rating
--- | ---
Dependency Inversion | ? | 1
Strategy | Behavioral | 2
Plugin | Behavioral | 2
Factory | Creation | 2
Builder | Creation | 2
Bridge | Behavioral | 3
Adapter | Behavioral | 4
Command | ? | ?
Facade | ? | ?

### Helpful Videos

To start learning about software design patterns, I started with youtube series and the author did a very good job. I would recommend these videos to anyone interesting in learning about software design. You can find the link to the series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR4-PBLUZNw&list=PLC0nd42SBTaNuP4iB4L6SJlMaHE71FG6N).
